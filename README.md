# pylibhuva

Basic utilities for pytorch, rfcn. Maybe tf sometime in the future also.

## Install instruction
Add something like below into your .bashrc, so that you can simply `import huva`


```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/pylibhuva
```
Install py-rfcn by following `https://github.com/Orpine/py-R-FCN.git`

Edit `huva/local_config.py` to correctly point to your py-rfcn folder.
